# VLSI-SoC-Design-RTL2GDS Flow using OpenLANE/Sky130
VSDSquadron, a cutting-edge development board based on the RISC-V architecture that is fully open-source and this processor has general-purpose interfaces that enable features of RISC-V ISA. In this workshop, I'm  focused on implementing the primary macro/block of the VSDSquadron processor using OpenLANE from RTL2GDSII. The VSDSquadron chip is a specialized development board often used in projects involving in various sensors, communication interfaces, and processing capabilities to support complex tasks.
